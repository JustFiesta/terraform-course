# Terraform Learning Repository

Welcome to my Terraform learning repository. This repository is dedicated to my personal journey of learning and practicing Terraform, and IaC.

## Prerequisites

Before I begin, I need to ensure I have met the following requirements:

- Installed [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- Understanding of infrastructure and cloud services.
