# Terraform Learning Repository

Welcome to my Terraform learning repository. This repository is dedicated to my personal journey of learning and practicing Terraform, and IaC.

## Introduction
This repository contains various exercises and examples that I am using to understand and master Terraform. Terraform allows me to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language.

## Prerequisites
Before I begin, I need to ensure I have met the following requirements:
- Installed [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- Understanding of infrastructure and cloud services.


## Resources
Here are some resources that I find helpful for learning Terraform:
- [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)
